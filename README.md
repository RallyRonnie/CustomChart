# Custom Chart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krmorse/CustomChart.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krmorse/CustomChart)

This app is the chart equivalent of the Custom Board and Custom List apps.  Pick a chart type (pie or bar), an artifact type, and a field to be aggregated and gain insight into your process via the generated chart.  Use the advanced filtering control to further slice and dice your data.  The data is also exportable for more fine grained inspection.

## Deprecation Notice

This app has been forked into the RallyCommunity organization and is no longer maintained here.  The latest app code may now be found here: https://github.com/RallyCommunity/CustomChart
